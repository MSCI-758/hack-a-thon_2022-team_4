# SPELL CHECK THIS


Intro:
Our group found that the priority ranking was a vague indicator of the differences among the impaired water bodies. The majority of the impaired water bodies on the 303d list were ranked as a `3`, which   We looked for realationships between priotity ranking and basin, cause, and use. We further investigate the causes of water body impairment in the 2018 data to disseminate trends. 

### Priority ranks

The priority ranks are defined as:


1 = __Current Priorities__ are those site/pollutant combinations being addressed by TMDL or
alternative restoration plans being developed during the 2016-2018 time-frame.


2 = __Near Term Priorities__ are those site/pollutant combinations being addressed by TMDL or alternative restoration plans being developed during the 2019-2022 time-frame.


3 = __Long Term Priorities__ are those site/pollutant combinations being addressed by TMDL or
alternative restoration plans being developed after 2022.

## Basin and priority rank:

### Priority rank and use

Uses are as follows:

* AL = Aquatic Life
* FISH = Fish consumption
* REC = Recreation
* SHELLFISH = Shellfish Harvesting

### Maybe make this barchart shorter in ggsave 


Aquatic life contains the only impairment listed as a priority ranking of 1. Fish is the only use that does not contain a priority ranking other than 3. Recreational and shellfish include 2 and 3 rankings. A priority rank of 3 being the majority of rankings across all uses. 

Although aquatic life is the majority use (n=590), we were surprised to find that it is the only use that had was being addressed or had a developing plan for addressing pollutants because we assumed water bodies being used for shellfish, fish, and recreation pose a larger threat to human health.  


### Causes and priority rank: 

![](figures/prank_causes_barplot.png){width=45%} ![](figures/causes_basins_heatmap.png){width=45%}

_Figure 4. (left) Bar plot depicting the various causes, filled by priority rank._  
  Most impaired bodies, regardless of their associated cause, exhibit a priority ranking of 3. Some impaired bodies (20-40) exhibit priority ranking 2, namely those with E.Coli, dissolved oxygen, pH, total nitrogen, and fecal coliform as causes. Impaired basins with total phosphorous listed as a cause have the highest count of priority ranking 2 when compared to other causes. 
  
  The ratio of priority rank for each cause could indicate that the causes with near term priority (priority rank 2), solutions already exist for TMDL to apply or are possible to develop plans for restoration. Total nitrogen (TN) and lead (PB) have a majority of near term priority rankings. 

_Figure 5. (right) Heat map of the various pairs between causes and basins of impaired water bodies._
  
  This heat map highlights the variation of frequency by cause between each basin. The Peedee basin has over 60 impaired bodies associated with mercury (HG), as well as 50-60 bodies associated with dissolved oxygen (DO). Both the Broad and Saluda basins have high counts of impaired bodies associated with biological causes (BIO). The most prevalent causes -  biological (BIO), mercury (HG), dissolved oxygen (DO), and *Escherichia coli* (ECOLI) - vary in frequency among the basins. Management plans by use and basin may be an efficient mode of planning. 


![Water bodies that have 2 causes attributed to their impairment.](figures/heatmap_2causes.png){width=70%}

Biological as a cause is missing from this heatmap, and it is not listed on the causes in the explanation of the data. Common pairings of causes include dissolved oxygen (DO) & hydrogen ion concentration (PH), mercury (HG) & polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), total phosphorus (TP) & total nitrogen (TN), and chlorophyll-a (CHLA) & hydrogen ion concentration (PH). 


### Causes and Usage

![](figures/AL_Uses_Causes_TEST_ALL_again.png)

_Figure 7. Bar plots depicting various causes associated with each basin. (A) Impaired water bodies listed as "Aquatic Life" under usage. (B) Water bodies listed as "Fish" under usage. (C) Water bodies listed as "Recreational" under usage. (D) Water bodies listed as "Shellfish" under usage._

  Water bodies used for aquatic life (Figure 7A.) display the most variety of causes associated with the different basins. The other three usages, however, have only one or two different causes associated with each basin. Interestingly, every single impaired water body that falls under the "Shellfish" category (Figure 7D.) is associated with fecal coliform bacteria. Fecal coliform bacteria, however, is never listed as a cause for the other usages. 

## Conclusion:
Priority rank is not a clear indicator of risk or importance, but is only a measure of DHEc planning for implementing solutions to water bodies. The most clear patterns we found were between use and cause see figure XX SHOULD WE LABEL FIGURES??? 

Auquatic life had the most impairments, and the most variation in causes. We were surprised by ranking and the only actively managed water body in 2018 being AL.
